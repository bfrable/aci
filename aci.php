          <h3>New opportunities give rise to new threats</h3>
          <p>The move to real-time payments requires real-time action, not after-the-fact responses. And the move to offer more payment channels requires comprehensive, proactive detection. Many institutions today still approach each channel with a different solution, leading to disjointed systems with limited lines of sight that are vulnerable to sophisticated, multi-pronged attacks.</p>

          <h3>Tremendous visibility. Rapid reaction. A fraudster&rsquo;s nightmare scenario.</h3>
          <p>ACI has built UP Payments Risk Management as part of an entire payments ecosystem.

Our solutions for both the financial and merchant markets put us in a unique position to identify and defend against new threats. And our real-time decision capability means we can quickly identify abnormal activity to stop fraud before the money goes out the door.</p>

          <h3>Push the implementation acclerator</h3>
